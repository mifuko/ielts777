It is widely believed in some countries that people think it is essential to buy a house rather than rent one. There are various reasons contributing to this, I consider this situation has an negative impact on the society.

Owning a house as a haven for recharging and relax is one dream of many people who are renting housing lately. A house totally belonging to someone brings a feeling of settled and relaxing, which is many people seek for. Therefore, due to the exceptionally high price of housing and wide gap between rich and poor in some regions, a flat or a house is not affordable for normal people, with others owning several houses at the same time. Some people have to rent a home for the children's education or the adults' work purpose, under the pressure of money shortage. Furthermore, the lack of government supervision on protecting the right of tenants makes people reluctant to rent a house.

In the short term, the thought of owning a home rather than renting one continues to encourage housing company to raise the prices of estate, which generates a harmful circle. In the long run, the sense of equality and harmony of society will be reduced.

Owning a home can bring a sense of fulfilment and relaxing, mentally, while renting one can also meet the daily needs. People should make proper choices based on actual requirement and self condition. Persisting on buying a house is harmful to personal growth and the society.


The thought of owning a home rather than renting one will encourage people to solid a determination to accumulate money and work harder, earning a higher salary, to achieve the goal as soon as possible. In the long run, the people with strong purpose will contribute more to the company and energize themselves, families and society, which can improve the atmosphere of harmony.
