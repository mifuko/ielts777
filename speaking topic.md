There are many visiable and invisiable way to help othters.I always offer my emotional support for my families and friends when they are going through a tough time.As a member of my family, I try to get houseworks done, such as wiping the floor or making biscuits to share.

3. Do your parents teach you how to help others?
Yes, my parents don't teach me about this behavior with aim, intentionally, they just have been my role model in teaching me about helping others. Being warm-hearted and compassinate is a kind of noble character for a human.I leearnt this from their examples in daily life.

4. Did your parents help you a lot when you were young?
Acutally not, my parents are farmers and they dont have plenty time to look after me. I was grown up countryside, a small town, they expected me to be an indepentdant teenager. Thanks to my neighbors and friends, they heled me go through my hard period. They always listen to me and stand by my side.

5. What have you done to help the elderly?
I have desgined a booklet to show the elderly how to use smartphone easily, such as downloading or removing apps, using mobile pay, taking videoes, which is difficult in exploring by themselves.If there is any chance, I think i will prepare to apply for voluntary works such as nursing. It will be helpful but for me it will be a chanllenge.


# Films

1. What films do you like?
I enjoy watching fantasy movies because they allow me to escape from reality and immerse myself in a dreamlike world for a couple of hours. These films often have magical creatures, epic battles, and inspiring stories that spark my imagination and transport me to a different world. Its a great way to relax and experience omething new and exciting.
 
Life of PI is my favourite movie, which is directed by Yann Martel,LIAN, one of the great director I admire. It's about the survival story of a boy and a tiger on a life boat at open sea.  It is a tale of faith, hope, and the brightness to survive.

The survival story of a boy and a tiger on a life boat at open sea. After surviving a ship wreck on his way from India to Canada with his parents, a brother and their zoo animals, the boy learns to survive by feeding the tiger with fish in order not to become the last meal of the tiger.

As a child, I often watched films with my parents as a reward for doing well in school. They would take me to the shopping mall to see a movie, and they would choose simple and warm films that were easy for me to understand. These experiences helped me develop a love for movies and a special bond with my parents.

3. Did you ever go to the cinema alone as a child?
No, As a child, I never went to the cinema alone to watch a movie. I always had my parents or other family members with me to ensure my safety and comfort. This was a common practice in my culture, where children were not allowed to go to public places alone until they were much older.

4. Do you often go to the cinema with your friends?
I go to the cinema with my friends quite often, as it's one of my favorite activities to do together. We enjoy exploring different stories and discussing our thoughts on the movies afterward.

# Transport

1. How do you go to work/school?
I go to work by walking, biking, or taking a taxi, depending on the weather and my mood. My flat is only 20 minutes away on foot, so I often choose to walk or bike to get there. Sometimes, if it's raining or too hot, I'll take a taxi instead. It's great to have options and be able to choose the best way to get to my destination based on the day's conditions!

2. What’s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?
In my hometown, the most popular means of transportation is driving a car. The town is quite small and rural, so most people own cars to get around easily. While there are some public transportation options available, such as buses, they are not as widely used as driving a personal vehicle. Additionally, the roads in the town are generally well-maintained and easy to navigate, making it convenient for residents to drive themselves to their destinations.

3. How far is it from your home to work / school?
The commute to my workplace is a pleasant 20-minute walk, which helps me stay active and energized. I track my steps using a health app on my phone, and it usually shows around 2000 steps for this distance. Walking not only contributes to my physical well-being but also allows me to enjoy the surroundings and clear my mind before starting the workday.

4. Do you think people will drive more in the future?
It is diffult to predict in certainty. There is a growing trend towards more sustainable transportation options these days. I believe that more people will choose public transportation, carpooling, or electric/hybrid vehicles in the future, given the increasing awareness of the environmental impact of private vehicle usage. This shift could lead to a reduction in the number of private vehicles on the road, resulting in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system.

1. Are robots important?
Robots have significantly impacted our society by revolutionizing the way we live and work, enabling us to accomplish tasks that were previously impossible.

No, I suppose I never see  movie about robots, but I've watched a short CG instead. The short animation is a commercial of a video game called Overwatch. The main character of the CG is robot named BASTION.I love the story, and the main theme  is talking about that every creature long for the peace rather than war although it is just a robot.

4. Should we let a robot drive for us for long journeys?
If I am sitting on driver seat, I will let my robot drive for me nodoubtly. In the long journeys, we ususally drive for hours and the surrouding almot keep same, it can be physically and mentally exhausting for human drivers. But for the robots, repetitive and dump task is suitable for them. The robot diriving will lead us to destination with safatey and comfort.

5. What can robots do for you at home?
Robots can do a variety of tasks for me at home, it's depending on their capabilities and the specific needs of my household. I am keeping a cat, so the cat feeding robots can be programmed to feed, walk, and play with pets, providing companionship and care for my fur baby.

# Gifts
1. Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?
While I don't often make handmade gifts due to my own limited crafting abilities, I try to choose thoughtful store-bought gifts that suit the recipient's personality and interests. The sincerity and meaning behind a gift matter more to me than whether it was homemade. If I had creative talents, I could see enjoying making special handmade gifts for loved ones. 



3. Have you ever received a great gift?
Sure, the most memorable gift I've ever received was a Nintendo Switch game console that my best friend Yang gave me for my birthday. I had mentioned to him a few months before how much I wanted to play the new Ring Fit Adventure, but couldn't buy the Switch in China. On my birthday he surprised me with it along with that game, I was so touched by his thoughtfulness. We play that game together on the Switch often, bonding over our shared interest. That heartfelt gift strengthened our friendship and gave me countless hours of entertainment over the past few years.

3. Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?
4. What do you consider when choosing a gift
When choosing a gift for someone, I first consider the recipient's interests, hobbies and personality to select something meaningful and useful for them. If they love reading, a book in their favorite taste would be ideal, while for a foodie, an interesting new ingredient could delight. 
I also think about the relationship closeness - a best friend deserves a more personal, sentimental gift than a work acquaintance. While staying within a reasonable budget, I aim for a high-quality, long-lasting item that suits them well over a lower-cost gift. Most importantly, I want the thought and care that went into selecting it to show.

# Fishing

1. Is fishing popular in your country?
According to my observation, Fishing's becoming popular around here lately. It used to just the elder, but now I can see people of all ages sitting on the shore to do fishing.I think with jobs more stressful, people dig fishing to spend leisure time.Sit still, and waiting for a fish to bite.It seems to take you back to nature and keep you away from all the noise. I might have to try it myself one of these holidays.

2. Do you like eating fish?
I'm not the biggest fan of eating fish, honestly. Dealing with all those tiny, tricky bones is too complicated for me. I'd much rather sink my teeth into a juicy steak or chicken breast than worrying a bone will get stuck in my throat. 
While I can't deny the health benefits of fish's lean protein, when given the choice, meat wins out for me every time. The flavor and smooth eating experience simply can't compare. 

3. Have you ever been to a place where there are lots of fish around you?
I actually tried fishing for the first time myself recently on a trip to visit some family in the countryside. I sat peacefully on the pond's shore, casting my line out into the water. I could sense the fish swimming all around beneath the surface, hoping to lure one in for a bite. Even without catching anything, just being immersed in nature and feeling the fish move around me was a cool experience I won't forget.

4. Have you seen any movies with lots of fish?
I actually can't recall main Hollywood movies that around fish. But I have watched tons of short fishing and marine life videos on different apps. They show helpful tutorials on techniques for catching different fish species. And they explore what kinds of amazing sea creatures you can find in oceans near the coasts. Those quick videos make the underwater world feel much more accessible.

Geography is an insightful subject to me. It teaches the logic behind things like landscapes, climates, and natural resources. Studying geography helps explain reasons for phenomenons and how societies developed. I've found geography reveals so many connections that deepen my understanding of the world.

3. Have you ever learned Geography?
I learned geography in primary and high school as a compulsory courses.In the class I have learnt some commone knowledge, for example, I learned the locations of countries, capitals, major rivers and mountains. We also studied climate patterns and key natural resources around the world. Examining maps and globes introduced me to continental shapes, country borders, and time zones. Those foundational geography lessons provided a helpful worldwide overview I still benefit from today.

4. Do you want to be a Geography teacher?
I'm interested in teaching geography to help students understand our interconnected world. Explaining climate patterns and natural resources can reveal how environments shape societies. And teaching foundational concepts like country borders and time zones provides real-world context students use daily.

# Tea and coffee

1. Do people like tea and coffee nowadays?
Sure, coffee and tea remain incredibly popular drink worldwide. Even though coffee did not originate in China, cities like Shanghai have fully embraced the cafe culture. In fact, Shanghai has the highest number of coffee shops of any city globally.
The popularity of coffee comes from the fast-paced lifestyle and long work hours that are common here. Workers seek out the caffeine boost coffee provides to help them stay alert and productive throughout their demanding days. 
Sipping coffee has become a daily routine and social activity for many workers in urban centers like Shanghai.

2. Do you prefer to use tea or coffee to serve your guests?
It depends. I tailor the beverage options based on their ages and preferences. For younger guests who tend to have fast-paced lifestyles, I'll offer coffee to provide an energy boost. But for older guests, I find tea is best as it's more elegant and formal - sipping tea peacefully, conducting a pleasant conversation will delight the guests.

3. When was the last time you had a cup of coffee or tea?
This morning. I will be a walking dead if I dont hava a cup of tea on the workday morning.The caffeine boost is essential for me to feel alert and productive during long hours at my desk.

4. Do you usually buy your coffee in a coffee shop
I usually grab my morning coffee from a nearby cafe rather than make it at home. The extra 10 minutes of sleep is worth more to me than homemade coffee. Though the coffee shop brew may not be as delicious, it provides the quick caffeine jolt I need to kickstart my workday. The takeaway cup is clean and strong enough to give me an energy boost to suffer long work hours.


# Running

1. Do you go running a lot?
3. What do you think of running as a sport?
Running's a pretty convenient sport you can do anywhere, no matter the weather or location. When it's nice out, I like going for runs outside to take in the views and get some sun. But if it's raining or cold, I can still workout inside on a treadmill. 
One thing I dig about running is I can squeeze in a jog whenever I have free time without needing any fancy equipment. Hitting the road or trails also gives me alone time to clear my head after a long day at work. Getting that fresh air does wonders for my mental health.

2. Where do you usually go running?
I like to go for runs outdoors in my neighborhood community since the roads are well-maintained with nice paths for runners. The area is safe and has minimal traffic so I feel comfortable jogging along at my own pace. 
Getting outside in the fresh air and taking in the neighborhood sights is a much more enjoyable running experience than using a treadmill indoors.

4. When was the last time you went running?
My last run was this past Sunday morning in my neighborhood. I went for about a 3 km jog, which took me around 30 minutes to complete. Since it's autumn now, the leaves lining the paths have turned golden yellow and fallen from the trees overhead.It was a nice refreshing start to the day getting my run in and seeing all the pretty fall colors.


# Noise

1. Do you like to stay in a place with a lot of noise?
4. What kinds of noises are there in the area where you live?
5. Do you want to move to a quieter place?

It's tough for me to relax and concentrate when I'm around constant noise all the time.
My current apartment is right near some busy roads and a construction site, so it gets noisy during the day. The sounds of traffic, trucks, and equipment can be super annoying from morning to night. Even late at night I get woken up sometimes by vehicles driving by or machines still running. All the noise pollution makes it hard to ever feel settled and at peace in my own home.
I'd love to bounce out of this noisy place and move to quiter place.A more peaceful spot with less traffic, construction and other sounds would be so much nicer.Getting rid of all this noise pollution and into some sweet, peace and quiet places is definitely a goal of mine.

2. Do you think there is too much noise in today’s world?
Yes, I think there is too much noise pollution in today's world. 
With so many electronics, vehicles, and people packed into urban areas,it's like there's always some kinda annoying sound happening. All the unnecessary noise makes it difficult to ever find a peaceful, quiet place to clear your head and recharge.

3. Is making noise one of people’s rights?
Yes, people have the right to make some noise, but not at the expense of others.
Even though we're all free to live our lives, there's still a social responsibility to avoid pointless disruption.Though we can't escape noise completely, we should try to minimize it when possible and be considerate of how it affects others around us.

Yes, I'm a greenhand of guitar player. I really enjoy listening to fingerstyle with technical and passion.
So I started to learn guitar a year ago.My teacher give the lesson 3 times a month. Playing guitar need a lot of practice and concentrates but really worthy when I listen to my performance.

Yeah, I'm a total newbie when it comes to playing guitar. 
I've always loved listening to complex, emotional fingerstyle guitar music. So I began taking lessons a few times a month from a guitar teacher to learn the instrument myself.  Even though it takes a ton of dedicated  practice, learning guitar has been really fulfilling as I hear my skills improving.

2. What musical instruments do you enjoy listening to the most?
I'm really into listening to fingerstyle guitar music. The melodies and emotion in fingerstyle totally speak to me. 
One of my fave fingerstyle songs is "Mr. Raindrop" by the Japanese guitarist Osamuraisan. Listening to relaxing guitar tracks like that helps me unwind and recharge after a long day.

Fingerstyle guitar:
- Uses fingers directly to pluck the strings , instead of guitar pick
- Allows intricate melodies and harmonies  
- Complex technique with both hands  

3. Do you think music education is important to children?
4. Do you think children should learn to play an instrument at school?
  
Yes, I believe music education is extremely important for children, as learning about music helps develop creativity, coordination, and emotional intelligence in kids. 
If given the chance to learn to play an instrument in school, children will be more willing and able to express themselves through music. Providing quality music education and instrument instruction in schools enriches children's overall development and quality of life. Music opens up new worlds for children to explore and helps them thrive in and out of the classroom.

Our wide-ranging conversations are always energetic and keep our friendship strong.

4. Do you prefer to communicate face-to-face or via social media?
Since most of my friends live far away, I prefer communicating via social media over face-to-face.
Time zones and miles can't stop us from texting and calling each other every day.Social apps let us stay super tight even when we're living in different cities. 
We catch up on life, crack jokes to make each other laugh, and share the latest memes and financial news. 
Our nonstop digital chats keep our friendships strong - distance doesn't matter!

3. Do you prefer to chat with a group of people or with only one friend?
Personally, I prefer having long, meaningful chats with just one friend at a time. We can totally focus on each other, spill our hearts out, and get closer.
Group chats with colleagues are useful too, especially for making plans or brain storming at work. But for close connections and heart-to-heart talks, I like to keep it to one-on-one conversations.

5. Do you argue with friends?
My friends and I never really argue. 
If there are disagreements, we have calm and rational discussions to resolve them. There has never been a heated dispute between us.
We discuss stuff peacefully to avoid unnecessary conflict.
At the end of the day, our friendships are more important than any petty beef.

# Map

1. Do you often use maps?
I frequently use maps on my phone. They are very convenient for navigating to unfamiliar destinations. When my friends and I go exploring new restaurants each week, I rely on my phone's map to guide us. The digital maps make it easy to find our way instead of using paper maps or finding the route myself.

2. How often do you use maps on your phone?

4. Do you have maps at home?
Since I downloaded map applications on my phone, I have not needed to rely on printed maps.
Paper maps can be difficult to carry with me and may not accurate enough.
Digital maps are more convenient and always up-to-date than paper maps. The core function for me is that, when I'am driving, digital maps can provide real-time traffic information and other features that can help me navigate more efficiently. 



# Clothing

1. Do you prefer to wear comfortable and casual clothes or smart clothes?
I prefer wearing casual and comfortable clothes. 
For example, hoodies are my favorite item to wear in autumn because they make me feel relaxed. 
I appreciate that my company has a loose dress code, so I can wear casual clothes to work. Formal clothing makes me feel uncomfortable. 
When I'm on vacation, I like being able to jog around the house in comfortable sweats instead of having to get dressed up. 
Overall, casual and relaxed outfits allow me to feel at ease in any situation. 

4. What kind of clothes do you like to wear?
3. Do you like wearing T-shirts?
Yes, I'm quite fond of wearing t-shirts. 
My colleagues and I often wear designed t-shirts with inside jokes or funny slogans on them. 
It's become a way for us to show our team spirit and bond with each other. 
I like being able to express myself through interesting or humorous t-shirt designs while still being comfortable. 

2. Do you spend a lot of time choosing clothes?
I don't spend a significant amount of time choosing what clothes to buy. 
I prefer to shop for clothes using online apps and websites. This allows me to efficiently browse many items and view photos and videos of how the clothes look when worn. 
Online shopping is very convenient as I don't have to go try things on in stores to get a sense of the fit. 
I find I can choose clothes quite quickly this way.

This experience taught me to appreciate time off and see possibilities during life changes. 
Now I'm better at balancing work and free time. Getting laid off changed my life in good ways by giving me a new outlook. 

Part 3

1. Do you like new things or changes in life?
In most of the situations, I will say yes. I view change as an chance for growth or improvement.
Nothing stays the same forever.
Rather than avoiding change, it's better to accept it.

Minor changes like trying something new are exciting. 
Bigger changes like moving or starting a new job can be stressful at first. But focusing on the positives helps me adapt. 

Overall, I'm open to change if I feel it's beneficial. But I also appreciate some stability and familiarity. Finding the right balance is important to me.

3. How do you adapt to changes in life?
Overall, I'm open to change if I feel it's beneficial.  I remind myself that change can bring new opportunities.
 I focus on things I can control, like learning new skills, fully use  stability and familiarity I know.
Talking to friends and family for support helps too.
Most importantly, I work on keeping a positive attitude.
If I fight against change, it makes it way harder to adapt. I take it step-by-step and look for any benefits the change might bring.


2. Why do some people quit and change jobs?
There are a few common reasons why people may quit or change their jobs.
Dissatisfaction with the work itself.
Unreasonable working conditions, like crazy hours with tiny pay
Having unfriendly or rude colleagues creates an unpleasant social environment that always drives people away.
workplace bullying, lack of respect also result to shift the job



4. Who can adapt better to changes, children or adults?
Children tend to adapt to changes much better than adults. 
Adults often struggle leaving behind stability and familiarity that they've grown accustomed to over many years. 
Children, on the other hand, are just naturally curious and open to new experiences, so change doesn't freak them out as much.
Their flexibility and eagerness lets them roll with changes without tripping.

5. When things like getting married or moving home happen, what kinds of things would you consider?
When major life events happen, like getting married or moving homes, I would consider much about practical factors.
For marriage, I would think about if my partner and I are truly ready for the next stage of life.Making that we can communicate, share values, and we've got the same goals for life.Whether we can make a budget as a team, figure out where we'd live together and all that.
When moving houses, I gotta think about what I can afford, the location, how much space I need, and how far it is from my work. 


6. What are the disadvantages when people keep making changes?
When people continuously make changes,they never get a chance to feel grounded.
Without putting down roots, they may feel unsettled and struggle to form strong connections and relationships with otheres.
Constant change can leave people feeling socially isolated, and unable to develop a solid sense of identity and belonging. (edited)


# 等待美好事情

Describe an occasion when you waited a long time for a nice thing

You should say:

When it happened
Last year in december.

What the nice thing was
waiting for my job offer

How long you waited
almost a month

Why you waited for a long time
because it is a state-owned company and need a lot of work flows

And explain how you felt about the experience

Last December I was waiting to hear back about a job offer from a state-owned company. 

I had interviewed almost a month earlier and still hadn't gotten final word. Since it was a big organization, I knew the hiring process would take a while with all their procedures and paperwork. The wait ended up being almost a full month before I finally got the offer.

That whole time I was a mix of excited and anxious. I really wanted the job - it was a great career opportunity for me. 
But the longer I went without hearing anything, the more doubts started creeping in. I kept wondering if they had decided on someone else and just didn't bother telling me. 
Each passing day built up my worries, even though I tried to stay positive.When the call finally came with the official offer, it was such a huge relief. 

Part 3:

1. On what occasions do people have to wait for a long time?
Waiting at restaurants - A crowded understaffed eatery can mean waiting ages for a table, then more waiting after ordering. Hunger pangs don't help.
Waiting for medical test results - Tests like bloodwork or biopsies can take days or weeks to get back from the lab. The wait for potentially life-changing news can feel anxious.

2. Do you like to wait for a long time? Why?
I'm not really the patient type to be honest.
Although sometime the long wait made that moment of victory even sweeter in the end.
But personally I don't like to wait for a long time. The longer I gotta wait on something, the more pressure and anxiety builds up in me.
I start overthinking and assuming the worst.

3. Why do most children have difficulties waiting for a long time?
Kids just don't have the patience us adults do.
They show restless  engergy all the time , sitting still for long periods goes against their nature.
We cannot expect them to waiting for a long time , they are unable to handle boredom like adults.

5. Are most people patient while waiting?
I don't think so.
In this fast-pace city,everyone wants to get news fast and avoid all the suspense. Their minds work better knowing things ASAP.
People like getting what they want when they want.
Some people may manage it , but in general, long waits drive people crazy.

4. What do people do while waiting?


6. Do people queue consciously while waiting for the subway train?
Nah, I don't think most people consciously queue up when waiting for the subway.
Poeple try to get close to where the doors open,  just wanna make sure they can actually squeeze on board.
They only care whether they can get a position, instead lining up on the platform politely.



# 让你开心的照片

Describe a photo that makes you feel happy

You should say:

When and where you took the photo
The photo was taken at my 30th birthday celebration

What the photo is like
It depicts myself and my dear friend Mia posing behind an birthday cake which she had prepared specifically for the occasion. 

How often you look at the photo
I was so pleased with how the image shows the joy of the evening that I chose to pin it to the top on my social media accounts.As it appears each time I post an update. I would estimate I am able to look at the photograph at least once daily.

And explain why it makes you feel happy
Whenever I lay eyes on it, I recall the fond memories of that wonderful night spent in the company of treasured friends. 

It just reminds me I've got the most thoughtful, caring friends in the world. Mia put so much love into every detail of that party to make sure I felt special. That cake was proof of it. Looking at that pic always puts me in the best mood and fills me with gratitude.



Part 3:

1. Do you think people take more photos now than in the past?
4. Do you think people are taking too many photos these days?

No doubt people take more photos nowadays versus the past.
I mean, old school cameras were heavy and film was mad expensive. You had to be make sure about what shots were worth it. But now?  We've all got smartphones that can get professional quality pics for free.
Furthermore, many people are run their self-media or have accsutomered to record life through photos.

With phones having unlimited storage, people snap pics of literally everything these days. Food, selfies, their pets - you name it, it's been photographed. It's just so easy to capture moments now.Especially for their social media, it's kinda extra to document your whole life online.

But in general, I don't have a big problem with it. If it makes people happy and they're not hurting anyone, then go crazy with the pics I say.


5. What kinds of photos do people like to take?
People love taking all kinds of photos these days but selfies are obviously a huge one.And food is another type, no meal is complete without a overhead shot.
Somethime people got their pet pics, vacation pics, #OOTD outfit pics.Anything people find cute, exciting, could be the photo material.

6. Why do some people like to post their photos on social media?
Some just want to share their life and cool experiences with friends and family.
Some of them would like to attract attention in order to be an influencer.
Posting pics can help boost people personal brand or make you seem more interesting. 
For influencers, it's a way to connect with followers and keep up their commercial value.

2. Do you think equipment is important for photography?

 Equipment definitely plays a role in photography, but I wouldn't say it's the most important factor.
Changing the lenses and cameras can provide great effect but the person behind the camera is what really matters.
You can have the fanciest gear, but if you don't have an artistic eye or technical skills, your photos will suffer.

3. Do you think being a professional photographer is a good job? Why?
I think professional photography can be a great career if you have the right skills packages and make sure you are fit enough.
Mastering technical skills like lighting, framing, and editing software is crucial for high quality photographs that earn client satisfaction.
Physical fitness allows photographers to withstand long hours on shoots carrying heavy equipment.
This career offers ample opportunities for skilled photographers who are dedicated to perfecting their craft
The skills decide how much you can earn, and your fitness decide how long you car.

# 成功的商业人士

Describe a successful businessperson you know (e.g., running a family business)

You should say:

Who this person is
Jack Ma is a famous Chinese entrepreneur who I greatly admire. He is the founder and former executive chairman of Alibaba Group, one of the world's largest e-commerce businesses. 

How you knew him/her
Although I have never met Jack Ma, I first learned about him years ago as a regular Taobao customer.

Part 3:

1. What factors lead to success?
There are several key factors that can lead to success. 
Having a clear vision and strong determination are important to stay focused. 
Developing skills through education and experience provides the abilities to achieve goals. 
Building good habits, working hard, and persevering through challenges are also essential for accomplishing long-term success.
With the right mindset and effort, I think most people can achieve success.

2. What do people need to sacrifice for success?
Reaching success often requires some personal sacrifices. For example, people frequently need to give up leisure time and hobbies to put in the hard work. Getting adequate sleep is another thing that is usually compromised, since ambitious individuals spend late nights striving toward their goals. The path to success can demand compromising comfort, free time, and sometimes personal relationships. But for many, the sacrifices are worth it.

3. Is it easy for a business to be successful without affecting the environment?
In today's world, I don't believe it's easy for any large business to avoid environmental impacts entirely. 
Traditional companies reliant on natural resources will surely affect the environment. 
However, service-based companies focused on human capital may have less ecological impact. 
But realistically, the activities of most major corporations will influence the environment in some way, even if unintended.

4. Which is more likely to be successful, family businesses or large corporations?
Both family enterprises and large corporations have pathways to success, in my opinion. 
Large companies benefit from standardized systems and processes to improve efficiency. 
However, family businesses are more agile and can make decisions faster. So there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. 
So while corporate giants can leverage their scale, family companies thrive on passion and flexibility.
There are pros and cons to both models when it comes to achieving success.


5. Can you provide some examples of family businesses in your country?
Some well-known family businesses in China include Huawei, Wanda Group.
These large businesses were founded by individuals or families and have expanded domestically and globally. 
Many traditional shops, restaurants, and small businesses are also family-owned and passed down generations. 
Family enterprises have made significant economic contributions in China over the past few decades. They provide employment opportunities and generate substantial domestic and international revenue.



6. What qualities should be considered when recruiting employees?
Several key qualities should be considered when recruiting employees. 
Strong technical skills and job knowledge are essential, but integrity, work ethic, and teamwork skills are equally important. 
The ability to communicate effectively and think critically are also vital for success in most roles. 
Ultimately, cultural fit and alignment with company values determine whether a candidate will thrive in an organization. 
The right mix of hard and soft skills can lead to successful hires.

Describe a party that you enjoy

You should say:

When and where the party was held
The party I'm going to describe was for my friend Mia's 30th birthday, which was held at her house last month.

Who attended the party
It was an intimate gathering with her closest friends, around 10 of us who have known Mia for years.

What kind of party it was
Mia decided to host a fun pajama party for her milestone birthday. We all turned up wearing our comfiest, silliest sleepwear to relax and enjoy ourselves.

What you did in the party
I performed a special guitar fingerstyle version of Happy Birthday for Mia as my gift. She was really touched and it was fun to celebrate her special day through music.

And explain why you enjoyed this party
It was one of the most enjoyable parties I've attended. I baked a cake to share and we all dressed down in our pajamas. The laidback, comfortable vibe made it feel more like friends reconnecting than a formal birthday party.


Part 3:

1. Why do people like parties?
People enjoy parties because they're a chance to socialize and connect with others in a relaxed setting. 
Parties help form new relationships as you meet people from different backgrounds. 
They also provide stress relief through dancing, drinking, and lighthearted conversation. 
Overall, parties allow people to strengthen bonds and blow off steam.

2. Why do some people not like going to parties?
Some dislike parties because loud music can be irritating, especially if held at someone's home late into the night, disturbing neighbors. 
Others may find big crowds overwhelming. Some are introverted and prefer quieter settings to socialize. 
Parties can also lead to unwanted peer pressure around drinking and other activities.

3. Do you think music and dancing are a must at a party?
Music is essential for setting the mood and sparking excitement at a party. Upbeat songs get people engaged and mingling. 
Dancing is optional though - some may enjoy it while others prefer chatting. 
Music should be loud enough to energize guests but not so loud that conversations are impossible.

4. What would you do if you were disturbed by a neighbour’s party?
If a neighbor's noisy party disturbed me, I'd first politely ask them to keep it down. 
If that fails, I'd check any noise regulations and lodge a complaint if they're violating rules. 
As a last resort, I'd contact building security or police if the party continued disrupting the peace. 
I try to resolve issues positively before reporting as a last measure.

5. What are the differences between holding a party at home and in a public place?
At home parties suit smaller groups of close friends, providing privacy. 
Public venues allow inviting broader acquaintances and meeting new people. 
Home parties have more flexibility while public spaces follow stricter protocols. 
Public sites may stay open later but home parties must be mindful of neighbors. 
Ultimately each location has trade-offs.

6. Do you think those who tend to stay at home are less healthy than those who often attend parties?
Not necessarily. 
Frequent partiers may neglect sleep and self-care. 
Homebodies maintain regular routines. 
While socializing benefits wellbeing, preferences vary - introverts recharge alone. 
As long as people are fulfilled and managing stress, neither lifestyle is inherently healthier. 
Moderation and self-awareness are key.
