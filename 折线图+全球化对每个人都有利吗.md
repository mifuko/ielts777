The line graph shows the distribution of the cinema attendance in four age groups between 2010 to 2016 in the UK.

Overall, the four groups witnessed the same increase trend in the proportion of cinema attendance. The age group of 15-24 stayed at the highest level, meanwhile the percentage of people aging from 35 and over remained at the lowest level during 16 years.

When it comes to the relatively young groups, the 15-24 group started from 15% in 2000, rosed to 50% by 2010 before decreasing to 38%, and reached the peak almost 60% in 2015. Next came the teenagers ranging from 7-14, the cinema attendance percentage rose from 10% in 2000 to 30% in 2016.

The percentage of audience aging from 25-35 was the third one at the start (3%), witnessing an increase, and ended up with the same position (30%) as the group of 7-14. In terms of the last group, the percentage of people watching movies in the cinemas at the age of 35 or older, increased steadily from 1% to 12% from 2000 to 2016.







The spread of multinational companies and the resulting increase of globalization produce positive effects for everyone.

0 positive to most people, some will be hit, they improve and government publish the policy help local and tax foreign  



The world is witnessing a globalization trend with the spread of cross-nation enterprises, which is likely to benefit everyone. In my opinion, this claim admits those visible merits and negelects potential problems.

The gobal companies are the pioneers who seeking for market development and promotion of supply chain. Foreign countries symbolize blue ocean markets. Making efforts to seize the emerged chances, businessman managed to control the costs by setting branches in some foreign countries where can reduce producing expenses. Thanks to this, products are accessable for customers at lower prices, which leading to a win-win result.

Furthermore, the following globalization brings about a series benefits to the society. As many multinational companies have settled down, the solid commercial atmosphere are well formed which will attract more foreign investments. The local people will have access to more job vacancies, whether created by local companies or foreign enterprises, due to the expansion of production. A lower rate of unemployment will enhence the stability of society, as everyone expected.

However, the introduction of companies with oversea investment probably hit the exsisted market and sharpen the fierce competition with local businesses. If the government could publish some policies to support those affected companies, and keep the stimulation within the moderation.

To sum up, although the globalization results in some local companies' dilemma, it is overall beneficial for the individuals and countries.
