The pie chart compares the post-graduate activities of ComputerScience majors after completing their undergraduate degreeprogram. 

Meanwhile, the table displays the salaries of ComputerScience graduates after five years of employment.


- overview

Overall, the vast majority of graduates work full time.

And most graduates have high salaries.

According to the pie chart, that the largest proportion of ComputerScience graduates are in full-time employment, at 67%.

Less than 10% of graduates are working part-time, unemployed, or unknown (5%, 7%, and 9%, respectively).

Based on the table, Computer Science graduates with salaries of $50,000-$99,000 are the least represented in all three occupations(software development, business management, and finance), as these workers account for less than 10%.

Graduates with salaries of $150,000-199,000 make up the highest
