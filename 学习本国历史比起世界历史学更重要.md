**_To what extent do you agree or disagree?_**

1 learn local, know country and ancestors, unity and identity, learn from history, role model their life and event turning point, nothing new in the sun, avoid mistakes made

2 learn world, know ancestor and others ancestor, not only domestic, prove each others history, help evidence of local finds

0 both, local first, world later

The issue of history study orientation of children has aroused intense debates among the general public. I strongly believe that it is essential for children to study both of local and world history.

Local history is always considered as the repositories of ancestors’ knowledge,meanwhile inextricably bound up in how the people lived in the past time. By understanding the local history, children are  not only encouraged to find out more about their country but also promoted feelings of national unity and cultural identity. Besides, there is nothing new under the sun, studying local history brings in success and failure experiences which children can draw lessons from. For example, in terms of historical celebrity , Isaac Newton as a role model of aspiration and perseverance shows the examples  for the children to imitate.

World history illustrates an overview of the development of the whole human being, including various cultures worldwide and the rises and falls of them, thus history of local country cannot not exist alone, being isolated from the world history. Children’s digging in the world history undoubtedly leads to their interests to explore more about other countries’ history, which are helpful to prove the validity of each other. Meanwhile, the richness and diversity in the world history will broaden their horizon, with knowing better about the positions and tracks of their homeland in the steam of history.

To summarize, no doubt that history study of local and world history is beneficial to children evenly. The former allows them to know their country thoroughly, and the latter covers more abundant contents.

Though there are differences in tradition and culture from region to region, and each region has a history of its own, they form the unity or spirit of oneness that is known as world history when combined. Therefore, the study of local and world history is equally important, as they are inextricably linked and interdependent.

There is an unbroken chain by which local history is indissolubly linked with the world history. On the one hand, studying the big picture of history such as the rise and fall of civilizations, major social and economic reforms and other events affecting the entire nation, peoples and the world at large is of critical significance. On the other hand, we should bear in mind that individuals, locales and communities all played a role in shaping and being shaped by the world history. Local history can be seen as a small-scale reflection of the grand scheme of historical development as it contains a wealth of details and stories that reveal how social changes impacted the lives of ordinary people, which in turn make up the larger pattern.

Local history and the world history interact with each other since the process of history is in effect about encounters, connections, integrations and assimilations, especially in the context of globalisation. For centuries, local cultures and traditions have been invariably associated with a wide range of adaptations and assimilations in response to foreign conquests, religious conversions, new technologies, strangers from afar and overseas imported commodities. As a result, many aspects including state constitutional structures and social foundations along with policy responses to challenges and opportunities tend to be the products of local-global connections.

In short, local history and world history, despite their diversities, share a strong invisible under-current of unity that nourishes and sustains the other. Therefore, comprehending the long-run history of humanity necessitates equal emphasis being placed on both of them.
