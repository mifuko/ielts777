- rewrite

The two diagrams illustrate stages of soybean growth and theproduction of soy milk, respectively.

- step details

During the growth of soybeans, first, after the soybean seeds are
placed in the soil, they grow into sprouts in about 2 weeks.

In the next phase, the sprouts gradually produce more leaves and
flowers, which then transform into pods.

The entire process of transitioning from sprout to pod takes about 4 weeks

Entering the final phase, the pods mature in 2 weeks and yield soybeans.

- step details

In the process of making soy milk, soybeans are first soaked in waterfor about 6 hours, and then the soaked soybeans are grounded, fromwhich the raw soy milk is obtained.

Notably,the ground soybean residue left over from this process canbe used to feed livestock.

Next, the raw soy milk is heated to 180 degrees to ensure sterilization.

In the final stage, the soy milk is bottled and packaged for distribution.

- sum up

In total, it takes 6 phases (about 8 weeks) to grow soybeans, while
the soy milk production process is much faster, requiring only 4 steps.
