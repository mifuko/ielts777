There is a phenomenon that nowadays traditional foods are vanishing from our daily life and the fast food take this vacancy precisely. Some people claims this detrimentally affect people's families and all the society. I agree with this opinion and believe people should be aware of the harmfulness and reduce consumption.

As we all known, frying is the most widely used method in cooking fast foods, which aborb much oil to the ingredients inevitably. The oil consumption, over moderate quantity, is harmful to people's overall well-being and probably lead to obesity in the long run. Meanwhile, the taste of fast foods are under expectation comparing to that of traditional foods. Furthermore, handmade traditional dishes are considered as a symbolization of family unity more than foods. The trational foods distinguished from the fast foods in the cookers' thoughfulness and warmcare included.

In terms of the society, it is wiped through by instant foods and embraced its culture of fast pace and short sight, which have long-term negative impacts. Furthermore, with the spead of fast foods restaurant, employers of traditional foods suppliers are suffering hits from serval aspects on the reduction of sale and customers. This situation will lead to a worse rate of employment in the foresee future.

Admittedly, most citizens are accustomed to the stressful and anxious lifestyles uncousiouly amid a fast-pace and competitive society. Thus fast foods can provide convenient basic energy and nutrition supply, what are exactly the busy people longing for.

Despite fast foods are easily to achieve and helpful to save precious time on cooking, the thoughtfulness behind traditional foods and the health habit informed are more important than store-bought fast foods.

In my opinion, fast foods negatively affect individuals and their families, as well as the society.
