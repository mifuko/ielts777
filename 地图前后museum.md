The diagram displays changes of a museum and its surroundings between 1990 and  2010.

Overall, the northern side remained the same while the western and south areas showed a brand-new appearance.

Regardless the garden stayed with no change on the of the map, the store in the northwest corner was enlarged and adjacent to the garden. Next to the store area, the exhibition was accessible from outside, which were occupied a rectangular area by the shop surrounded, resulting to the expansion of the shop and reduction of the exhibition.

The cottage was distributed at the southwest corner, which was replaced with a cafe without any area variation in 2010. In terms of the right region of the map, car park was divided into two parts, with the northern kept as a carpark and the southern was rebuilt into a garden in 2010. The path to the Garden and exit crossed the whole museum was unchanged.



sample:


The maps demonstrate the changes of a museum and its related facilities during the period of two decades.


In 1990, there were **two gardens located in the northern and southeastern part relatively**. **Along the western side of the museum**, the areas of store, exhibition, shop and cottage **were situated from north to south**. What is worth noticing is that **a path lay in** the middle of the museum **connecting all the facilities together and leading visitors to the exit**. Along the eastern side**, the car park was built next to the garden.


However, in 2010, **some variations ranging from coverage area to function can be observed**. For example, the size of both store and shop increased, which means that the store **was expanded by seemingly taking up some empty space** and **the shop occupied what was used to belonging to the exhibition**. Therefore, the exhibition **shrank accordingly due to its close position with the shop**, which was quite noticeable from this layout of the museum. In addition, the original cottage **was altered into** a caffee, while the former garden **in the southeastern corner was transformed into** another smaller parking space for visitors. **From what can be seen from these two maps**, the northern garden, the eastern parking lot, the path and exit **all remained the same** during two decades.


In conclusion, some changes were made to the museum which made it possible to hold more visitors.
