4. In some countries, young people have become richer, healthier, and live longer, but they are

less happy. What are the causes? What can be done to address this situation?

（如何解决经济高速发展下年轻人缺乏快乐的问题）

It is becoming a common phenomena that despite the wealth, good health and longer life expectancy, the young group feel less happier than that in the past time.The causes are various but I consider the social isolation is the biggest reason to unhappiness.

Some countries are developing at a high speed with providing many chances for people to get rich and live a better life. The human relationship nowadays is weaker than before while technology and science are rapidly developing, meanwhile people are busy with their own life and neglecting the connection with others. The lack of companion and support with young people tends to give them the feeling of isolated and lonely rather than happy. Although the teenagers have the latest communicating method and tools,such as smartphone and video chat,  they still rarely begin a conversation and ask for help or support.

In order to tackle this issue, government should take the responsibility and emphasize young people’ mental health. Different types of campus and community activities should be held such as interest workshop, which can enrich their social and life experience, with immersing them into the atmosphere of engagement and shared interest. Furthermore, advertising the affects of young people stuck in isolation and feeling unhappy for a long term is crucial for parents in family and supervisors in campus. Besides the government, the whole society should help build the teenager with their spiritual building.

During the period of rapid growth, people bury their head and make money while ignore the importance of interpersonal relationship which give the young people the feeling of social isolation. The government should take measurements to improve young people’s mental experience, with preventing them from feeling lonely and unhappy.
