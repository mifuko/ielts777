There is a common phenomenon that international organization shoud provide aids to developing countries. Some people argue that commercial aids should be at the first place, while others claim the advice and practical can give more help. I strongly stand with the former ones, direct financial aid are more essential for developing countries to help them through tough period by developing infrastructures.

On the one hand, practical aid and advice are better for developing countries to imitate and learn the successful methology, which indicates the countries to explore their own way to develop. Through this kind of aids, developing countries can build a specific science and technology system in the long term, since relying on the outside force isn't a long-lasting solution. For example, the international organization can help the developing country to establish a team of technological talents and get trained to learn about the advantageous and successful experience and apply them to the practice.

On the other hand, providing direct financial aid is helpful to address the problems that are facing with the developing countries and urged to be tackled in short time. When natural disasters or regional conflicts happen in a developing country, people suffer from diseases and starving. International organizations provide financial aids which can immediately relieve the situation, demonstrating international friendship and noble humanity. Moreover, besides people’s necessity, direct money support is important to help improve medical services, schools and roads, which are necessary to develop further.

Overall, although practical aid and advice are crucial for the developing countries to find their own way to conquer difficulties, financial aids bring more benefits to solve urging problems.
