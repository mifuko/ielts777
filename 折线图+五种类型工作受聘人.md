The bar chart illustrates how many people worked in different sectors in a particular Australian area in two separate years: 2001 and 2008. Overall, by far the most individuals were employees in the sales industry while the fewest worked in the farming area.

In terms of sales, approximately 155,000 and around 165,000 people worked as a sales representative in 2001 and 2008 respectively. Although the numbers of those employed in the computing and nursing industries were similar initially, at roughly 55,000, yet while the figure for those employed in the computing sector saw a moderate growth to about 57,500 in 2008, that for those with a nursing position rose significantly, reaching just under 80,000 in the end. 

Regarding the other two types of work, there were more than 60,000 accountants in 2001, andthe number was considerately higher than that of farmers, at about 25,000. However, fewer people had been recruited in these two areas by 2008, and the figure was nearly 60,000 for accounting and almost 20,000 for farming.
