The graph shows the process of how to recycle plastic bottles and turn them in to products.
- The process diagram which is given above illustrates the process of recycling bottles.

There are nine steps in the whole process, mainly includes collecting, verifying, crushing, heating and producing.
- In general, there are nine stages to produce new plastic products from the old plastic bottles which start from collecting bottles and end with the manufacture of new products.


People verify plastic bottles from others when they throw waste in daily life, dropping them into the recycle bin. Specific trunks for recycling carry wastes to the recycling center for further sorting, where workers distinguish plastic bottles from other recycling waste on the transport band. Those picked out plastic bottles are dropped into the correct bin.
- According to the given diagram, old plastic bottles are collected from different areas in the trash containers in the initial stages. Then the collected bottles are taken to the recycling centre to separate them manually. Then the next step, bottles are sent to the compressing machine to make them huge blocks that look like a cube.


After that, the plastic bottles are compressing into blocks tightly, which are prepared to get crushed by two wheels with teeth. The processed tiny parts need to be washed and cleaned.

After inputting the parts into a machine, where produce plastic pellets, with warm heated, the pellets are transformed to form raw material. Then, raw material of plastic are cooled down and set with order, ready to be transferred and used. The wide range of consumers goods are produced from these plastic raw material.
- Subsequently, the cube is transferred to a crushing machine to break it into small pieces and they are allowed to fall into the water to destroy the pollutants. The pieces of plastics are poured into the machine which turns them into little plastic pellets. In the following step, these pellets are heated to generate the raw materials needed to create completed plastic goods like bottles, containers, t-shirts, and carry bags.


  
WRITING TASK 2

You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

Write about the following topic:

**_In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passengers._**  

**_Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?_**

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.




It's widely believed that future transportation like trunks and buses will be operated without drivers, which means there will be no people expect passengers. I think this change will improve people's experience and be more friendly to the environment, although there are some potential risk.

Stepping in to the era of driverless transportation, it is relevant that existed the advanced automation system, which is well-designed to drive or operate the vehicle will definitely replace drivers. For example, a bus driver is supposed to be responsible to take all the passengers to the destinations safely no matter what happens. However, if the driver is exhausted or in bad health, he can not make correct and fast judgement when driving, all the passengers will be put in danger. Automatic driving can avoid these issues. Moreover, by controlling the labor cost, the transportation companies will be beneficial for this evolution, which also will lessen the financial burden of government's public service expenditure. Meanwhile, driverless technology are always applied to those renewable or hybrid vehicles, with less energy consuming and less exhausted gas emitting. This is environment friendly which is essential for the society and helpful to reduce air pollutant.

However, some people concern about the replacement of drivers will reduce employment rate and probably erase this kind of job from history. What's more important, how can the driverless vehicles ensure safety without human supervision remains a question.

To sum up, driverless vehicles are friendly to environment and have positive impacts on improving people's life quality, although there is some safety issue which can be solved with the continuous development of technology in the future.
