The bar chart illustrates the frequency with which people swam in Australia between 2001 and 2003.

- overview

In sum, the proportion of people who swam irregularly weekly and monthly was the highest.

As for those who swam with different frequencies, the trends varied from 2001 to 2003.

- detail 1

Of these, the largest group was those who swam at least once a week, with an average percentage of over 25% and a peak over 35%.

The percentage of people who swam one to two times a month was also high, with the lowest measurement being only 25%.

At the same time, 15% to 20% of the population swam several times a week or several times a year, while only about 5% of people swam every day or never swam at all.

- detail 2

In 2002, there was a large increase (about 5%) in the percentage of
people who swam once a week and a considerable decline (more than 5%) in the percentage of people who swam once or twice a month.

During these three years, there was relatively little variation in the
percentage of people who swam daily or several times a year,
fluctuating only by 1 to 2%.

Of the trends monitored, only the percentage of those who never
swam showed a continuous downward trend throughout the course of the three years.
