sample：

The diagrams illustrate the layout of a sports centre at a university as it is currently and the projected plan for after it has been redeveloped. The two key changes are that the centre will be completely indoors and will have a wider range of facilities after the redevelopment.
Presently, the centre consists of an indoor facility flanked by outdoor courts on the east and west. The entrance to the indoor facility is on the south side with a reception opposite it. An entry to the left (west side) of the reception leads to the changing rooms whilst another on the right (east side) leads to seating overlooking the 25m pool in the centre of the building. There is a doorway from the changing rooms to the pool and a gym is on the north side of the facility.
The development project envisages an extension of the building at the cost of the outdoor courts whilst broadly maintaining the original floorplan. In the reception area, there will be a sports shop to the left (west) and a café to the right (east). Beyond the sports shop, there will be changing rooms for people using the leisure pool which will take up most of the western side of the centre. Past the café, there will be another changing room which will serve the eastern side of the building, most of which will be a sports hall and two dance studios. In addition, the gym will be extended eastwards, approximately doubling in size.
