If I am the driver, I will let my robot drive for me nodoubtly and I will make sure it's under my supervision.

They can make life more convenient by taking care of repetitive chrores.



# Gifts
1. Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?
While I don't often make handmade gifts due to my own limited crafting abilities.
I try to choose thoughtful gifts that suit the recipient's personality and interests. 
The sincerity and meaning behind a gift matter more to me than whether it was homemade. 
If I had creative talents, I could enjoy making special handmade gifts for loved ones. 


2. Have you ever received a great gift?
Sure, I've received some amazing gifts over these years.
The most memorable gift was a Nintendo Switch game console that my best friend Mia gave me for my birthday. 
I had mentioned to him a few months before how much I wanted to play the new Ring Fit Adventure, but couldn't buy the Switch in China. 
On my birthday he surprised me with it along with that game, I was so touched by her thoughtfulness. 
We play that game together on the Switch often, bonding over our shared interest. 


3. Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?
Yes, I believe I'm decent at choosing gifts. 
I will consider whether the person need or like according to his interest and personality.
while staying within a reasonable budget,  I aim for a high-quality, long-lasting item that suits them well , rather than a lower-cost gift.
Most importantly, I want the thought and care can be showed through the gifts.

4. What do you consider when choosing a gift?
5. How to choose a gift?
When choosing a gift for someone, I first consider the person's interests, hobbies and personality to select something meaningful and useful. 
If they love reading, a book in their favorite taste would be ideal, while for a foodie, an interesting new ingredient could delight. 
I also think about the relationship closeness - a best friend deserves a more personal, sentimental gift than a work acquaintance. 


# Helping others

1. Do you usually help people around you?
Sure. I try to offer the help to those who need whenever I can.
Helping others is a warm behavior. For example, if my friends or colleages find some diffculties in study or work, I am willing to help them if I have the ability they just need. 
It brings me a sense of fulfuillment, and meanwhile I think patience and friendness really does matter in relationships. 
 
2. How do you help people around you, such as neighbours, family and friends?
I help them by offering practical tasks to my neighbor because of the short distance between our  houses.
For example, my neighbours have left for a long vocation for serveral days, I help keep their pets and look after them carefully.
Helping people also benefits me, I feel peacefull when I stay with the cats.

There are many visiable and invisiable way to help othters.
I always offer my emotional support for my families and friends when they are going through a tough time.
As a member of my family, I try to get houseworks done, such as wiping the floor or making biscuits to share.

3. Do your parents teach you how to help others?
Actullay, my parents don't teach me about this behavior with aim, intentionally, they just have been my role model in teaching me about helping others. Being warm-hearted and compassinate is a kind of noble character for a human.
They also encourage me to do voluntary and contribute to our community.

4. Did your parents help you a lot when you were young?
Acutally not, my parents are farmers and they dont have plenty time to look after me. 
I was grown up countryside, a small town, they expected me to be an indepentdant teenager. Thanks to my neighbors and friends, they helped me go through my hard period. They always listen to me and stand by my side.

5. What have you done to help the elderly?
I have desgined a booklet to show the elderly how to use smartphone easily, such as downloading or removing apps, using mobile pay, taking videoes, which is difficult in exploring by themselves.
If there is any chance, I think i will prepare to apply for voluntary works such as nursing. It will be a rewarding and challengeable experience for me.



# Fishing

1. Is fishing popular in your country?
According to my observation, Fishing's becoming popular around here lately. 
It used to just the elder, but now I can see people of all ages sitting on the shore to do fishing.
Sit still, and waiting for a fish to bite.It seems to take you back to nature and keep you away from all the noise. 


2. Do you like eating fish?
I'm not the biggest fan of eating fish, honestly. Dealing with all those tiny, tricky bones is too complicated for me. 
I'd much rather sink my teeth into a juicy steak or chicken breast than worrying a bone will get stuck in my throat. 
While I can't deny the health benefits of fish's  protein, when given the choice, meat wins out for me every time. 
The flavor and smooth eating experience simply can't compare. 

3. Have you ever been to a place where there are lots of fish around you?
Yes, I recently tried fishing for the first time myself on a trip to visit a scenic pond in the countryside. 
I sat peacefully on the pond's shore, casting my line out into the water. 
I could sense the fish swimming all around beneath the surface, hoping to lure one fish for a bite. 
Even without catching any fish, just being immersed in nature and feeling the fish move around me was a cool experience I won't forget.

4. Have you seen any movies with lots of fish?
I actually can't recall a main Hollywood movies that around fish. 
But I have watched tons of short videos featuring  fishing and marine life on different apps. 
They show helpful tutorials on techniques for catching different fish species. 
Additionally, they explore the amazing sea creatures that you can find in oceans near the coasts. 
Those quick videos make the underwater world feel much more accessible.


# Geography

Geography is an insightful subject to me. 
It teaches the logic behind things like landscapes, climates, and natural resources. 
Studying geography helps explain reasons for phenomena and how societies developed.

Yes, Geography helps me to find so many connections that deepen my understanding of the world.
It's essential for navigation, weather forecast and  urban planning. The grography also help people to figure out climate patterns and how to find key natural resources around the world, which is the foundation of society development.

3. Have you ever learned Geography?
I learned geography in primary and high school as a compulsory courses.
In the class I have learnt some common knowledge, for example, I learned the locations of countries, capitals, major rivers and mountains. 
Examining maps and globes introduced me to continental shapes, country borders, and time zones.
Those foundational geography lessons provided a helpful worldwide overview I still benefit from today.

4. Do you want to be a Geography teacher?
Yes, if I have the choice.
I'm interested in teaching geography to help students understand our interconnected world. Explaining climate patterns and natural resources can reveal how environments shape societies. 
And teaching basic concepts like country borders and time zones can help provide real-world context ,that students use daily.



# Musical instruments

1. Have you ever learned to play a musical instrument?
Yes, I'm a greenhand of guitar player.
I really enjoy listening to fingerstyle with technical and passion.So I started to learn guitar a year ago.

I will practice more in my leaisure time because it is a so fun and rewarding hobby.


4. Do you think children should learn to play an instrument at school?
3. Do you think music education is important to children?
Yes, I believe music education is extremely important for children, as learning about music helps develop creativity, coordination, and emotional intelligence in kids. 
If given the chance to learn to play an instrument in school, children will be more willing and able to express themselves through music. 
Providing quality music education and instrument instruction in schools also enrich children's overall development and quality of life.


5. Have you taken any classes on musical intruments in school?
Yes, I did take some violin lessons during my primary school. 
My parents consider it just a hobby rather than a tools to gain rewardings so that they did't push me to attend violin lessons at that time.
What a pity I gave it up until 2 years learning. I still appreciate this experience that arousing me the interest in music, which helped me with building basic understanding of string instruments.


2. What musical instruments do you enjoy listening to the most?
I'm really into listening to fingerstyle guitar music. The melodies and emotion in fingerstyle totally speak to me. 
One of my fave fingerstyle songs is "Mr. Raindrop" by the Japanese guitarist Osamuraisan. 
Listening to relaxing guitar tracks like that helps me unwind and recharge after a long day.

6. How easy would it be learn to play an instrument without a teacher?
Learning any intrument without a professional tutor can be quite challenging.
Despite the wealthy online course rescouces and flexibility that self-learning provids, it's difficult for the learners to practice in a proper way. Furthermore, how to express strong emotions and feelings is an eternal and essential topic to play an instrument which cannot be simply taught through internet.



# Tea and coffee

1. Do people like tea and coffee nowadays?
Sure, coffee and tea remain incredibly popular beverage worldwide. 
Many people start their workday with a cup of tea or coffee for asborb caffeine that energizes abd keep them alert.

In fact, Shanghai has the highest number of coffee shops of any city globally.


2. Do you prefer to use tea or coffee to serve your guests?
It depends. 
I tailor the beverage options based on their ages and preferences. 
For younger guests who tend to have fast-paced lifestyles, I'll offer coffee to provide an energy boost. 
But for older guests, I find tea is best as it's more elegant and formal - sipping tea peacefully, conducting a pleasant conversation will delight the guests.

3. When was the last time you had a cup of coffee or tea?
I had a cup of tea this morning. 
I will be a walking dead without a cup of tea on the workday morning. The tea helps me kickstart my day with a burst of energy, meanwhile it keeps me staty productive during long hours at my desk.

4. Do you usually buy your coffee in a coffee shop
I usually grab my morning coffee from a nearby cafe rather than make it at home. 
The extra 10 minutes of sleep is worth more to me than homemade coffee.
Sipping coffee has become a daily routine and social activity, though the coffee in strore maybe not so delicious, it can provide the quick caffeine jolt I need. 
The takeaway cup is clean and strong enough to give me an energy boost to suffer long work hours.



# Map

1. Do you often use maps?
I frequently use maps on my phone. 
They are very convenient for navigating to unfamiliar destinations.
When my friends and I go exploring new restaurants each week, I rely on my phone's map to guide us. The digital maps make it easy to find our way instead of using paper maps or finding the route myself.

2. How often do you use maps on your phone?
I use maps on my phone almost everytime I explore unfamiliar regions.
My friends and I have a tradition of trying a new restaurant every week. The map app equiped with GPS navigationon my phone makes it easy for us to explore different parts of the city. 
Without it, we'd constantly be lost or struggling with oldschool paper maps.

3. Do you use paper maps?
Since I downloaded map applications on my phone, I have not needed to rely on printed maps.
Paper maps can be difficult to carry with me and may not accurate enough.
Digital maps are more convenient and always up-to-date than paper maps. 
The core function for me is that, when I'am driving, digital maps can provide real-time traffic information and other features that can help me navigate more efficiently. 

4. Do you have maps at home?
Yes, I have some paper maps on the bookshelter at my home.
Those were bought by my dad, who is a big fan of travelling. Actually these maps are out of date over 10 years, so that they cannot be used for navigate anymore. I still treasure them as a souvenir to help memorize the amazing days that people use paper maps to travel around.



# Chatting

1. Do you like chatting with friends?
I love chatting with my friends - it's the highlight of my workday. 
Our conversations flow easily, whether we're catching up about life, joking around, or share new memes. 
Talking and laughing together strengthens our connection and always leaves me feeling happy and supported.

2. What do you usually chat about with friends?
My friends and I chat about anything and everything! 
We catch up on life, crack jokes to make each other laugh, and share the latest memes and pop culture news. 
Lately we've also been discussing our stock investments and finances quite a bit, comparing our strategies and tips. 
Our wide-ranging conversations are always energetic and keep our friendship strong.

4. Do you prefer to communicate face-to-face or via social media?
Since most of my friends live far away, I prefer communicating via social media over face-to-face.
Time zones and miles can't stop us from texting and calling each other every day.
Social apps let us stay super tight even when we're living in different cities. 
Our nonstop digital chats keep our friendships strong - distance doesn't matter!

3. Do you prefer to chat with a group of people or with only one friend?
Personally, I prefer having long, meaningful chats with just one friend at a time. 
We can totally focus on each other, spill our hearts out, and get closer.
Group chats with colleagues are useful too, especially for making plans or brain storming at work. But for close connections and heart-to-heart talks, I like to keep it to one-on-one conversations.

5. Do you argue with friends?
My friends and I never really argue. 
If there are disagreements, we have calm and rational discussions to resolve them. 
There has never been a heated dispute between us.We discuss stuff peacefully to avoid unnecessary conflict.
At the end of the day, our friendships are more important than any petty beef.



# Noise

1. Do you like to stay in a place with a lot of noise?
No, I prefer living in a quiet place.
It's tough for me to relax and concentrate when I'm around constant noise all the time.
Especially, I have sleeping problem so even tiny sounds will wake me up by noise which will detroy my sleep. So that I cannot recharge for the next day.
All the noise pollution makes it hard to ever feel settled and at peace in my own home.

4. What kinds of noises are there in the area where you live?
Currently I live in the apartment, which is right near some busy roads and a construction site, so it gets noisy during the day. 
The sounds of traffic, trucks, and equipment can be super annoying from morning to night. 
Even late at night I get woken up sometimes by vehicles driving by or machines still running. 


5. Do you want to move to a quieter place?
I'd love to bounce out of this noisy place and move to quiter place.
A more peaceful spot with less traffic, construction and other sounds would be so much nicer.
Getting rid of all this noise pollution and into some sweet, peace and quiet places is definitely a goal of mine.


2. Do you think there is too much noise in todayâ€™s world?
Yes, I think there is too much noise pollution in today's world. 
With so many electronics, vehicles, and people packed into urban areas,it's like there's always some kinda annoying sound happening. 
All the unnecessary noise makes it difficult to ever find a peaceful, quiet place to clear your head and recharge.
Suffering from long-term and exceesive noise will enhance the feeling of stress and anxiety and affect our overall well-being.

3. Is making noise one of peopleâ€™s rights?
Yes, people have the right to make some noise, but not at the expense of others.
Even though we're all free to live our lives, there's still a social responsibility to avoid pointless disruption.
Though we can't escape noise completely, we should try to minimize it when possible and be considerate of how it affects others around us.



# Films

1. What films do you like?
I enjoy watching fantasy movies because they allow me to escape from reality and immerse myself in a dreamlike world for a couple of hours. 
These films often have magical creatures, epic battles, and inspiring stories that spark my imagination and transport me to a different world. 

2. Did you often watch films when you were a child?
As a child, I often watched films with my parents as a reward for doing well in school. 
They would take me to the shopping mall to see a movie, and they would choose simple and warm films that were easy for me to understand. 
These experiences helped me develop a love for movies and a special bond with my parents.


3. Did you ever go to the cinema alone as a child?
No, as a child, I never went to the cinema alone to watch a movie. 
This was a common practice in my culture, where children were not allowed to go to public recreation places alone until they were much older.
During my childhood, I always had my parents or other family members with me to ensure my safety and comfort. I really chrished those mements.


4. Do you often go to the cinema with your friends?
I go to the cinema with my friends quite often, as it's one of my favorite activities to do together. We enjoy exploring different stories and discussing our thoughts on the movies afterward. Going to the cinema is a great way to spend quality time with my friends and have a fun and relaxing experience.

5. Do you think going to the cinema is a good way to spend time with friends?
6. Do you often go tho the cinema with your friends.
Definitely.
I think going to the cinema is a great way to spend time with friends! 
Its a great way to relax and experience something new and exciting. That allows us to escape reality and immerse ourselves in a different world which will let us forget stress of real-life.
Plus, it's a great opportunity to bond over our shared love of movies and discuss our thoughts and opinions afterward.


 
Life of PI is my favourite movie, which is directed by Yann Martel,LIAN, one of the great director I admire. It's about the survival story of a boy and a tiger on a life boat at open sea. The boy learns to survive by feeding the tiger with fish in order not to become the last meal of the tiger.
It is a tale of faith, hope, and the brightness to survive.




# Running

1. Do you go running a lot?
Yes. I go running several time a week.
I can go running whenever I have free time without needing any fancy equipment.Getting that fresh air does wonders for my mental health.
I usually go for a run in the evening. Hitting the road or trails gives me alone time to clear my head after a long day at work. 

3. What do you think of running as a sport?
It is a simple and cost-effctiveway to help stay fit and maintain physical health.
Plus, running's a pretty convenient sport you can do anywhere, no matter the weather or location. 
When it's nice out, I like going for runs outside to take in the views and get some sun. 
But if it's raining or cold, I can still workout inside on a treadmill. 

2. Where do you usually go running?
I like to go for runs outdoors in my neighborhood community since the roads are well-maintained with nice paths for runners. 
The area is safe and has minimal traffic so I feel comfortable jogging along at my own pace. 
Getting outside in the fresh air is a much more enjoyable running experience than using a treadmill indoors.

4. When was the last time you went running?
My last run was this past Sunday morning in my neighborhood. 
I went for about a 3 km jog, which took me around 30 minutes to complete. 
Since it's autumn now, the leaves lining the paths have turned golden yellow and fallen from the trees overhead.
It was a nice refreshing start to the day getting my run in and seeing all the pretty fall colors.



# Transport

1. How do you go to work/school?
I go to work by walking, biking, or taking a taxi, depending on the weather and my mood. 
My flat is only 20 minutes away on foot, so I often choose to walk or bike to get there. 
Sometimes, if it's raining or too hot, I'll take a taxi instead. 
It's great to have options and be able to choose the best way to get to my destination based on the day's conditions!

2. Whatâ€™s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?
In my hometown, the most popular means of transportation is driving a car. The town is quite small and rural, so most people own cars to get around easily. While there are some public transportation options available, such as buses, they are not as widely used as driving a personal vehicle. Additionally, the roads in the town are generally well-maintained and easy to navigate, making it convenient for residents to drive themselves to their destinations.

5. Is driving to work popular in your country?
Yes, more and more commuters choose to drive to work.
The convenience and flexibility it offers can lebrate them from exhasting experence of public transportation.
This is also the reason that causes traffic jams in cities during rush hour.
And for those rural and suburban areas, driving helps people travel around easily since there are limited public tranportation.

3. How far is it from your home to work / school?
The commute to my workplace is a pleasant 20-minute walk, which helps me stay active and energized. I track my steps using a health app on my phone, and it usually shows around 2000 steps for this distance. Walking not only contributes to my physical well-being but also allows me to enjoy the surroundings and clear my mind before starting the workday.

4. Do you think people will drive more in the future?
It is diffult to predict in certainty. 
There is a growing trend towards more sustainable transportation options these days. 
I believe that more people will choose public transportation, carpooling, or electric/hybrid vehicles in the future, since people have the awareness of the environmental impact of private vehicle usage. 
This shift could lead to a reduction in the number of private vehicles on the road, resulting in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system.





# Clothing

1. Do you prefer to wear comfortable and casual clothes or smart clothes?
I prefer wearing casual and comfortable clothes, and I appreciate that my company has a loose dress code, so I can wear casual clothes to work. Formal clothing makes me feel uncomfortable. 
When Iâ€™m in some specific ocasions, I have to dress up in smart clothes which will rein my mood.


4. What kind of clothes do you like to wear?
I'm quite fond of casual wear, including sneakers, T-shirts.For example, hoodies are my favorite items to wear in autumn because they make me feel relaxed. 
However, if there is a certain dress code for a party or meeting, I'll obey that and dress up formally, which always at the expense of comfort.

3. Do you like wearing T-shirts?
Yes, I love wearing T-shirts, especially in workplace.
My colleagues and I often wear designed t-shirts with inside jokes or funny slogans on them. 
It's become a way for us to show our team spirit and bond with each other. 
I like being able to express myself through interesting or humorous t-shirt designs while still being comfortable. 

2. Do you spend a lot of time choosing clothes?
I don't spend a significant amount of time choosing what clothes to buy. 
I prefer to shop for clothes using online apps and websites. This allows me to efficiently browse many items and view photos and videos of how the clothes look when worn. 
Online shopping is very convenient as I don't have to go try things on in stores to get a sense of the fit. 
I find I can choose clothes quite quickly this way. 



# Travelling

1. Do you like travelling?
Yes, I'm quite fond of traveling. 
I find it very exciting to visit unfamiliar places and take in new sights and experiences.
Travel allows me to broaden my perspectives and gain fresh outlooks.
When I'm on a trip, I feel a sense of anticipation about what I might discover just around the next corner.


2. How often do you go travelling?
I try to travel at least a few times a year for shorter trips. My family also tries to take one big trip annually. 
How often I travel really depends on things, like getting time off work aligned with family members and organizing visas.
But we try to at least do an annual warm weather trip over the Spring Festival break. 
So yeah, I try to travel regularly even if it's just quick trip.


3. Where do you usually travel?
For longer vacations, I often travel to warm destinations in southern regions. Some places I've visited include beach areas like Hainan or mountainous regions further inland. 
For shorter trips, I usually stay closer to home and explore different cities within my country. 
Where I travel really depends on the season and how much time I have available for the holiday. 


4. How do you feel when you are travelling?
I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. I enjoy taking a break from my normal routine and experiencing new places.
Traveling allows me to take a relaxing break from my regular routine. Getting out to explore new destinations gives me the opportunity to broaden my perspectives.

# Dream and ambition

1. What was your childhood dream?
My childhood dream was to become a photographer. 
Even as a young child, I loved taking photos of my family, pets, and favorite toys. I was fascinated by how photos could capture moments and tell stories. 
I begged my parents for cameras and filled up albums with pictures. Photography looked like so much fun to me.

2. Are you the kind of person who sticks to dreams?
I generally try to stick to my dreams and ambitions if they are reasonable and achievable. 
As a child, I held on to my dream of being a photographer even through middle school and high school. I worked hard in art classes, did photography projects, and aimed for a career in the arts. If I set a dream that excites me, I will persist through obstacles to achieve it.

3. What is your dream job?
My dream job is to be a professional photographer with my own studio. 
I want to take beautiful portraits, wedding photos, and landscapes. My dream is to capture life's special moments through my photography and share them with the world. 
I can't imagine a more rewarding career than pursuing my passion for photography every day.

4. Do you think you are an ambitious person?
Yes, I would describe myself as an ambitious person when it comes to my career aspirations. 
I set high goals for myself and imagine my dream job vividly. I am motivated to put in the hard work necessary to earn the qualifications and experience I need to achieve my dream of photographer.
I am a driven person who doesn't let setbacks stop me from pursuing my ambitions. 

# Ice cream

1. Do you like ice cream?
I'm not a huge fan of ice cream. The coldness combined with the overwhelming sweetness is not really to my taste. 
I will occasionally have a small bowl if someone serves it to me, but I don't choose to eat it often. There are many other desserts I prefer over ice cream.

2. Do you eat ice cream a lot?
I would not say that I eat ice cream a lot. Maybe a few times during the hot summer months I'll have a little bit, but I don't crave it. 
Friends always want to go out for ice cream, but I usually just get a small cup or opt for something else on the menu. 
I prefer desserts that are not quite so cold and sugary.

3. Did you eat ice cream when you were a child?
As a child, I did have ice cream sometimes when my parents served it. 
But even then, I remember liking the experience of going out for ice cream more than eating the ice cream itself. 
I didn't ask for or seek out ice cream very often as a kid. It was never my favorite treat.

4. Are there shops selling ice cream near the place where you live?
Yes, there are quite a few shops selling ice cream near where I live. In the summer they always have long lines out the door! 
I sometimes walk by and see the colorful tubs of ice cream on display. 
The shops look festive and fun, but I rarely go in to actually order any. 
The cold, sugary ice cream just isn't appealing to me.

5. Would you like to make your own ice cream?
I don't have a strong desire to make my own ice cream. 
There are many other fun, creative desserts I'd rather try my hand at baking. 
Icing cakes, making fruit tarts, or baking cookies seem like better options that I would enjoy more. 
If I ever did decide to make ice cream, I would try to make it with less sugar and richer flavors. But itâ€™s not at the top of my list. 

Concentration

1. Did you stay focused in class when you were a child?
As a child in school, I tried my best to stay focused in class but it was a challenge. 
My mind would easily wander or I'd get distracted by things happening around me. 
My teachers often had to remind me to pay attention to the lessons and not daydream or chat with classmates. 
Staying focused for long periods was difficult for me even back then.

2. Are you a focused person?
I would not describe myself as a very focused person. I tend to be easily distracted, especially by things going on around me. 
If there is background noise or visual stimuli, I have a hard time blocking it out and staying centered on the task at hand. 
My mind tends to be jumpy and I multitask too much. 
Staying intensely focused on one thing is a skill I'm still working on.

3. How do you stay focused?
To try to stay focused, I have found some techniques that help me temporarily at least. 
I turn off my phone and move away from my computer to avoid distractions. I play peaceful music to drown out errant noises.Taking short breaks helps me re-center. 
I also divide a big task into small part and set specific goals for each simple step, since I could focuse for a short time.

4. Is it easy to stay focused in a noisy environment?
No, it is not easy at all for me to stay focused in a noisy environment. 
Background noise like conversations or music playing are very distracting. I wish I could just tune it all out but I can't seem to manage it well.
My productivity definitely suffers when working or studying in a loud cafe or area with visual distractions.Nosise-cancelling headphones are necessary for me to aid me with concentrade.


# Fixing things

1. Can you fix things?
I would say I have decent skills when it comes to fixing simple things. 
As long as it's not something hugely complex, I can usually diagnose basic problems and find solutions to repair items. 
Things like assembling furniture, patching drywall, or changing phone screens I can handle pretty well at this point. 
I seem to have a knack for mechanical and hands-on fixes.

2. Did anybody teach you to fix things when you were a child?
Yes, my dad taught me a lot about how to fix things and make repairs when I was growing up. 
He always involved me in household projects and walked me through the steps to repaire broken appliances or do basic troubleshooting. 
Those skills have really stuck with me into adulthood and given me confidence to take on fix-it projects. I'm thankful for those lessons from my dad.

3. Do you think it is necessary for people to learn to fix things?
I do think it's valuable for people to learn basic repair and fix-it skills. 
It not only promote self-independence, but also cost-effective and more sustainable than constantly replacing items. 
Possessing some mechanical problems is a useful life skill in my opinion. People don't necessarily need advanced training but having those basics skill will avoid some unconvenience.

4. What do you do when a thing is broken and cannot be fixed?
If something broken and it seems completely irreparable, my first instinct is still to troubleshoot it myself. 
But if it's clear it can't be fixed by my abilities, at that point I would seek assistance. 
For complex electronics or appliance issues, I would call in a professional. I know my limits on repairs, and when advanced expertise is needed, it's worth the cost.

Yes, I often try to go out with friends as much as I can - at least once or twice a week if possible. Scheduling frequent meetups is important so we stay connected.
It could just be grabbing dinner, seeing a movie, or exploring parts of the city.
Those outings help us catch up and stay involved in each other's lives.

3. Where do you often meet each other?

Going out around town is nice, but sometimes a more lowkey night in at home catching up works too. 
Wherever we meet up, the point is being together and continuing our conversations.

4. What do you usually do with your friends?
My friends and I enjoy various activities, from outdoor pursuits like hiking or cycling around the city, to indoor recreations like playing games or watching films. 
Just chatting over a meal out is also time well spent. 
The activity itself isn't as important as the companionship.

5. Do you have a friend you have known for a long time?
Yes, I have one friend I've known since we were classmates in primary school, so for over two decades now! 
We have a lot of shared history and it's amazing to have maintained the friendship into adulthood. 
That type of close, lifelong friend is really special.

My favorite day of the week is definitely Friday. After a long work week, knowing that the weekend is just ahead makes Fridays so enjoyable. 
I can finish up any last tasks and then relax knowing I can sleep in the next morning. 
Fridays have such an optimistic energy since the freedom of weekend is coming.

2. What is your least favorite day?

I cherish having that freedom and contrast on the weekends.

Iâ€˜d like to take full advantage of any sunny skies and mild temperatures by heading outdoors. 
When the weather is pleasant, I spend my weekends doing activities like taking a scenic hike, pedaling around the city on my bicycle.

A rainstorm now and then improves my mood.

2. Does it rain much in your city?
Yes, it does rain quite frequently in Shanghai, especially in the summertime. 
The hot, humid summer months often produce afternoon thunderstorms that roll through the city.

3. Would you like to live in a dry or wet place?
I think I would prefer to live in a relatively wet, rainy climate overall. 
While too many gray days could be depressing, I find occasional rainy days and periods add nice variety to the weather.
The smells, sounds, and ambience of the rainy season make me happy.
Moderation is best, but a completely dry climate would not suit me.

4. Would you change your plan if it rained?
For a light drizzle, I generally would not alter my plans. A little rain is refreshing and I don't mind getting wet.
However, if there is a severe thunderstorm or downpour, I would likely change an outdoor activity to something indoors.
Or in some cases of heavy rain storms, I may just cancel my plans and stay home until it passes. Safety comes first in extreme rain. 

# Day off

I appreciate that days off give me more opportunities to connect with loved ones.


4. What would you like to do if you had a day off tomorrow?
If I woke up tomorrow with a surprise day off, I would start by making a nice big breakfast to enjoy slowly. 
With no agenda for the day, I'd be able to fully relax and recharge. I would likely call up a few friends to see if anyone wants to meet up and do something fun together on the spur of the moment.

2. What languages would you like to learn in the future?
Looking ahead, I would be eager to take up studying Spanish in the future. 
The sound of Spanish is very beautiful to my ears, with its flow and words that melodically end in 's'. Becoming skilled in Spanish would also open up opportunities to communicate with more people around the world.

3. How do you learn a foreign language?
For me, the most effective way to pick up a new foreign language is through a combination of self-study and more formal lessons.
I like using online courses and apps for cost-efficient, self-paced learning of vocabulary and grammar.
However, working with a professional tutor or teacher accelerates progress through expert instruction and speaking practice.

4. How are languages taught and learned in your school?
In my secondary school, languages were taught through analyzing sample texts, articles and passages in the target language. 
We would study the vocabulary, grammar and sentence structures.

Zhujiajiao is a relatively small suburban town with only one subway line connecting it to Shanghai. However, it remains very clean and still attracts thousands of visitors every day who come to walk the scenery riverside streets.

So it is no longer my permanent home, though I'm sure I'll visit.


Where would you like to live?
Somewhere with a similar relaxed pace and beautiful natural scenery as my hometown, but with more vibrant culture and career options. I want the best of both worlds. 

# Home/Accommodation

1. Do you live in a house or a flat?
2. Can you describe the place where you live?
I reside in a small flat on the third level of an older apartment building without a lift. 
It's a modest two-bedroom apartment with a tiny indoor balcony overlooking the lively street below.
While not ideal, the location's perfect to my workplace makes the commute quite convenient.


3. Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?
Without question, I would favor residing in a proper house rather than a flat. 
A standalone home would provide more room, outdoor space for a garden, and increased privacy.
My current flat can feel cramped and lacks those qualities a house usually offers.


4. How long have you lived there?
I've occupied flat ever since I started working at my present company. 
It's served as a comfortable, easily accessible dwelling for my daily life and work commute over the years.

I've personalized the space with photographs I took myself and some character figurines, reflecting my appreciation tastes.



Which room does your family spend most of the time in?
The living room is our most frequented area, apart from sleeping quarters. 
My flatmate and I often play videogames together on the couch or chat with visitors there. 
Its central location connects all other rooms and its well-furnished so it is a good place to relax and have some conversations.



What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?
At home, I tend to unwind and decompress after taxing workdays. 
Lounging on the sofa , wiping shor videos on smartphone or attempting new recipes with my flatmate are favorite pastimes. 
My home provides a quiet, warm harbour for me to recharge and enjoy my alone time.


Who do you live with?
i shared the flat with a close friend and we also have an adorable cat that brings liveliness to our humble dwelling. 
My flatmate and I divide household chores equally in order to keep our home comfortable and well organized.
Living with my friend is like having a support system and we always enojy meals together.


Are the transportation facitilies to your home very goodï¼Ÿ

I intend to remain in my current convenient apartment for the foreseeable future, as the location suits my work commute well. 
However, it's challenging to predict with certainty where I might live in the more distant future.


What is the difference between where you are living The primary difference is the setting. 
I formerly dwelled in a lively neighborhood near shops and recreation.
In contrast, I now inhabit a rural area closer to my workplace. It's been a considerable lifestyle adjustment.

Do you think it is important to live in a comfortable environment
I believe it's very important to reside in comfortable surroundings that promote overall well-being. 
An uncomfortable, stressful home environment can negatively impact mood and harmful to mental health.

One noticeable change recently is the new construction of a large shopping mall, which has stores like restaurants, a movie theater, and shops. 
I became a member of the nice new gym located inside the mall as well. 
The new development is modernizing the area but still retains the small-town charm.

Do you know any famous people in your area?
Yes, there is a well-known local merchant here named Alan who has run his family breakfast restaurant and refreshment store for at least 20 years now. 
Alan's little shop attracts residents every morning for tasty food and beverages. He's quite renowned in our town for his quality products and friendly service.


Where do you like to go in that area?
I love exploring the central park in our area during my free time. 
I enjoy going fishing by the peaceful pond located in the park and running along the well-maintained jogging trails. 
The natural scenery helps me relax and reflect. The central park is definitely my favorite local spot.
