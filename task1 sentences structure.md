# 评分注意

a.概括段的总结开头用词不要写in conclusion, 可以写overall, to summarise, in summary等。

b.如果考场时间不够，概括段可以写在开头段之后。

c.概括段不要出现数据。

d.概括段不要揣测数据变化的原因，不要给建议。

e.单纯按照图表中看到的順序列出數據這是低分最常見的原因之一，必須分析並將數據分組以獲得高分。

f.描述趋势和例外情况，才有高分的可能，至少使用“The main trend is. . .，The exception is…”並簡單地描述您可以看到的最引人注目的數據。用同一模式概括多个信息，不需要把不重要的信息逐一描述，如果把相似的描述重新说一遍，除了有凑字数的嫌疑以外，考官会觉得你没有语言概括能力。

g.不要使用太多数字，加入描述群体的数字，如，“They are all around 50”）而不是報告一大組中的每個單獨數字

h.字数请控制在150-170个字，官方要求150字

i.不要用 I, Me, We...等第一人称

| Overall, xx made up a higher proportion of yy than zz, and this difference is particularly noticeable in aa | We can also see that the most common xx in yy was zz         |

| While all cities saw a net increase in xx by 2022, the most dramatic increases happened between 2017 and 2020 | In spite of this overall trend, there were a number of rises and falls in growth, with all cities showing a decrease in growth in 2011 |
| The data shows an overall rise and fall in both income and spending between young, middle-aged, and older Americans | Income rises and falls more sharply than spending            |
| Average monthly rainfalls are usually higher from June to September and tend to be lower between October and May. | However, rainfall can differ a good deal between towns, and these differences add up to distinctly different annual numbers. |
